# Criteria -- Formal Genre Markers

A *formal genre marker* is part of an overriding classification scheme rather than a one-off description of a particular item. 

My criteria:

- The markers are used consistently over a series of titles in a defined collection over a defined period of time
- The markers correspond to what we now would recognize as genre terms, even if they're not explicitly labeled as genre (I've seen "category", "theme", etc used instead of "genre" and this is okay)
- The markers can be simply words, or also iconography, so long as they're consistent
- The size and duration of the defined collection doesn't really matter -- one issue of one magazine is sufficient as long as there's an obvious classification scheme
- Formal genre markers *do not appear in isolation*, but appear as a defined set of markers that are applied consistently to a set of items, in order to differentiate them according to what we would now recognize as genre.
- Merely describing a game with a genre term in a review, marketing copy, or box art does not constitute a formal genre marker. There must be other titles that are using the same classification scheme to which the presentation of the genre term belongs.

Example of formal genre marker:

The "Action" emblem is used consistently across multiple different titles, along with a set of different icons for other genres.

NOT examples of formal genre markers:

Dragon Warrior is described as a "Role-Playing epic" which is indeed a genre term, but this box art was a) designed by Enix and not Nintendo, and b) the term is just incidental marketing copy rather than part of an official genre classification scheme. If Enix had produced a variety of titles for the NES and consistently applied their own genre classification system, this *would* count as a formal genre marker.
