# Formal Genre Markers

In this file I'm specifically looking for *formal genre markers*, which is not the same as merely mentioning the genre term in marketing copy or in review text.

A *formal genre marker* is part of an overriding classification scheme rather than a one-off description of a particular item. My criteria:

- The markers are used consistently over a series of titles in a defined collection over a defined period of time
- The markers correspond to what we now would recognize as genre terms, even if they're not explicitly labeled as genre (I've seen "category", "theme", etc used instead of "genre" and this is okay)
- The markers can be simply words, or also iconography, so long as they're consistent
- The size and duration of the defined collection doesn't really matter -- one issue of one magazine is sufficient as long as there's an obvious classification scheme
